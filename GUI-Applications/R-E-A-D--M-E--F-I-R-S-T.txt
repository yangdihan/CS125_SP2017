This ungraded project demonstrates how to create simple GUI applications.

It also uses two tools:

Ant - an automated build system
JSmooth - builds 'exe' files to run your program.

Ant runs small tasks inside a 'build.xml' file.
The build file in this project creates a jar file
(a zip of all the required files) 
and then calls JSmooth to build the windows executable file:

<jar basedir="../bin" destfile="dogyears/DogYears.jar" compress="true" manifest="../src/dogyears/MANIFEST">
	<include name="dogyears/*" />
</jar>
<jsmoothgen project="DogYearsExeConfig.jsmooth"  skeletonroot="jsmooth-0.9.9-7/skeletons"/>

The jar file itself is executable:
java -jar DogYears.jar
... but Window's users want a simple .exe file. Enter JSmooth.
JSmooth is controlled by a simple configuration file.
You don't need to edit the configuration file directly
instead JSmooth includes a GUI configuration editor to set the correct options.
(JSmooth can bundle the jar into the exe - which is useful for small projects)

To build the jar and the exe files,
(0)
If jsmooth crashes with an exception, it's probably because it couldn't load the icon.
So check the path points to an actual graphics file in jsmooth's configuration file.

If building on linux or mac, you'll need to replace the .jsmooth files with
the files inside 'replaceConfigsWithThesesWhenBuildingOnAMacOrLinux'
-These versions change the following options

<executableName>dogyears\DogYearsBundled.exe</executableName>
<iconLocation>..\src\dogyears\dog.jpg</iconLocation>
<jarLocation>dogyears\DogYears.jar</jarLocation>

to use forward slashes - 

<executableName>dogyears/DogYearsBundled.exe</executableName>
<iconLocation>../src/dogyears/dog.jpg</iconLocation>
<jarLocation>dogyears/DogYears.jar</jarLocation>

right click on the 'build.xml' in the build/ subdirectory
and select 
Run AS> Ant Build

For really large projects, don't bundle the whole application into a single .exe file.
Instead you'll need a third tool to create an installer.
An installer can also create Desktop shortcuts and associate your program
with specific kinds of files. (Consider nullsoft's installer and izpack )

Have fun building GUI apps!
